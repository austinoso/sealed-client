# Sealed Messaging App 

* [Sealed Backend](https://github.com/austinoso/capstone-messaging-api)
* [Live Demo](https://sealed-client.herokuapp.com/)

Sealed is a concept messaging app I developed as my capstone project for Flatiron School. At Flatiron we were tasked with putting together all the skills we picked up over the 15 week long course and building a web app within 3 weeks.

Sealed takes advantage of single use "burner chats" designed increase security by allowing users to quickly and easily delete all previous chat messages with another user.
